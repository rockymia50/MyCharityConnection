**Real World Problem:

People young and old have much less time on their hands then they have had in the past. People still want to donate and volunteer their time as well. However, some may have difficulty finding such opportunties and/or discovering a charity or cause that they would like to donate towards. 

**How can we solve this?

Charity Connection allows users to select wether they would like to either donate or volunteer and will direct them to the corresponding application. Upon arriving, users will have the ability to search areas for volunteer opportunites as well as search by category for the style of voltuneerism. Such as food shelters or tutoring. On the flip side, should a user like to donate, we offer them a few different options. As users who are coming to this site they most likely do not know how they would like to donate their money. And so, we provide them the oppotunity to search by category with results including direct links to that specifc charities donation page. Furhermore, provide a random donation option where a user can simply click a randomize button and and we will provide a charity for you at random! Please try our app!
